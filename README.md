# Analyzing-Data-from-a-Prepared-Meal-Delivery-Service-Company

In this project, I use the statistical programming language R to analyze data collected by a local company that prepares meals and ships them to the customerâ€™s home. Their marketing group sent out a survey
to their customer list and received responses from 600 current customers. Through statistical data mining and testing methods, including ANOVA, correlations, t-tests, and chi-square tests, I answer 2 research questions regarding satisfaction levels among customers and their relationships with other factors. These are then used to generate valuable consumer insights and inform actionable business decisions for the meal delivery company in brief executive summaries.
