# Analyzing-Data-from-a-Prepared-Meal-Delivery-Service-Company

Overview:
In this project, I use the statistical programming language R to analyze data collected by a local company that prepares meals and ships them to customers' homes. Their marketing group sent out a survey
to their customer list and received responses from 600 current customers. Through statistical data mining and testing methods, including ANOVA, correlations, t-tests, and chi-square tests, I answer 2 research questions regarding satisfaction levels among customers and their relationships with other factors. These are then used to generate valuable consumer insights and inform actionable business decisions for the meal delivery company in brief executive summaries.

In this report, I analyze data collected by a local company that prepares meals and ships them to the customer’s home. Their marketing group sent out a survey
to their customer list and received responses from 600 current customers.
The survey included questions about a customer’s age (‘age’), annual income
(in tens of thousands of dollars) (‘annual_income’), typical daily commute time
(in minutes)(‘commute_time’), a scale that measured their openness to new
experiences (‘open_personality’), diet preference (‘diet’), whether the receive
meals need assembling (‘assemble_meals’), whether they live with others
(‘live_with_others’), whether they need a gluten-free diet (‘gluten_free’),
and finally, a scale that measured customer satisfaction with the product
(‘satisfaction’).
I use these to answer two research questions, and use a significance level (alpha)
= .05 for all the statistical tests I conduct.
